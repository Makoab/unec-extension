In the top-right corner of the Extensions page, toggle on the "Developer mode" switch.

Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.

Navigate to the folder where you saved your extension files and select that folder.

Once loaded, the extension will appear in your list.

Click the puzzle piece icon (Extensions icon) in your Chrome toolbar.

Find "UNEC Elektron Jurnal Viewer" and click the pin icon next to it. This will make the extension icon visible in your toolbar for easy access.

‚ö†Ô∏è Troubleshooting
"Error fetching and populating options: TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'success')" or similar errors:

This often means the extension couldn't fetch the year/semester options from the UNEC portal.

Solution: Ensure you are logged in to kabinet.unec.edu.az in the same Chrome profile where you are using the extension. The extension relies on your active session cookies to access the data.

Solution: Reload the extension from chrome://extensions after ensuring you are logged in.

"He√ß bir kurs m…ôlumatƒ± tapƒ±lmadƒ±." (No course information found):

This could mean there are no courses for the selected year/semester, or the extension couldn't parse the course list correctly.

Solution: Verify that you are logged into UNEC and that courses are visible for the selected year/semester on the actual UNEC portal.

Extension icon is a "U" letter:

This means your custom icon files are either missing, incorrectly named, or have incorrect dimensions.

Solution: Ensure icon16.png (16x16), icon48.png (48x48), and icon128.png (128x128) are all in the same root directory as your manifest.json and are valid PNG files. Reload the extension.
